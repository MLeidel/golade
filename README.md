# golade
**A Glade / Gtk 3 to Go Sketcher**

`golade` creates a Go program using your Glade (xml) definition file.  
It fills in all of the global widget object, signal connections and  
handler function bodies.  

Usage: `golade my.glade > my.go`  

The UI should run (display) at this point; without fully functioning widgets.

Run: `go run my.go`
